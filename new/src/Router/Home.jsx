            <h1>MS Dhoni's Fight</h1>
            <p>MS Dhoni, Indiaâ€™s legendary former captain and finisher, 
               was the last recognized batsman at the crease. 
               With India needing 148 more runs from 120 balls, the equation was daunting, 
               but Dhoni, known for his calm and calculated approach under pressure, began to rebuild the innings.</p>

                <h1>India's defeat</h1>
                <p>The run out of Dhoni became a symbol of the end of an era for Indian cricket, marking what could be considered his final World Cup appearance. 
                    It was a fittingly dramatic and emotional moment for a player who had been central to India's success in ICC tournaments over the years.</p>

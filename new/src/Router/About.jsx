                <h2>Introduction</h2>
                  <p>MS Dhoni is one of the most iconic and successful cricketers to ever play the game. 
                    Known for his calm demeanor and sharp cricketing mind, 
                    Dhoni's rise from a small-town boy in Ranchi to one of the most successful captains in the history of Indian cricket is nothing short of inspirational.
                     Under his leadership, India achieved immense success, including winning major ICC tournaments such as the ICC T20 World Cup 2007, 
                     the ICC Cricket World Cup 2011, and the ICC Champions Trophy 2013.</p>

                <h2>Early Life and Career</h2>
                <p>Born into a middle-class family in Ranchi, 
                    Jharkhand, MS Dhoni initially played football and badminton before gravitating toward cricket. 
                    He was a talented goalkeeper in football, 
                    and his reflexes on the field were a key factor in his future success as a wicketkeeper. 
                    Dhoni's early cricket days were spent playing for local clubs, 
                    and his performances in school and college cricket tournaments eventually led to his selection for the Bihar U-19 team.
                </p>
                
                <p>In 2001, he made his debut in the domestic circuit playing for Bihar and later moved to Jharkhand following the creation of the state.
                     His explosive batting and sharp wicketkeeping skills caught the attention of selectors, 
                     and in 2004, he was selected for the Indian national team for an ODI against Bangladesh.

                <h1>ODI Cricket</h1>
                <p>MS Dhoni's journey in One-Day Internationals (ODIs) started with a stunning 0â€“0 run in his first few matches,
                     but his explosive innings against Pakistan in 2005 established him as a player to watch.
                      His innings of 148 against Pakistan in 2006 cemented his place in the Indian squad.

                    <h1>Test Cricket</h1>
                    <p>MS Dhoni took over as Test captain in 2008, following Anil Kumble's retirement.
                         He led India to its first-ever No. 1 Test ranking in 2009, 
                         a testament to his leadership skills and tactical acumen. 
                         Under his captaincy, India achieved significant Test series wins, notably against New Zealand, West Indies, and Australia. 
                         Dhoni's most memorable Test moment was his unbeaten 224 against Australia in 2013 in the series that India won at home.

                        making India the inaugural T20 World Cup champions.
